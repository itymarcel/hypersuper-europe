        <div class="headline" style="margin-top:50px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1.7;"><i>Theo 3</i> is a percussive melodic collaborative musical instrument. It presents an opportunity for a communal music making experience for non-musicians and musicians, young and old.
Almost 4 meter long and wide, <i>Theo 3</i> is a xylophone-type instrument, hit with either hands or sticks, that sparks curiosity for music making, while connecting people through a collaborative and creative activity. <i>Theo 3</i> is based on research that looks at how people form relationships in public space and how these relationships facilitate open-mindedness and reflectiveness.</div>

        Music making can produce a mental state in which we sometimes forget about everything around us. A state in which our mind is more free from the known. Can we use this state of mind to bring people together, free of their cultural and social background? And perhaps even make them talk to each other, if only for a couple of seconds?</div>!-->

It shows an easy to access approach to music making by simplifying notes and tuning. A circular arrangement suggests playing it in a group.<br/><br/>
          The instrument has been inside and taken outside, establishing environments to question its form and functionality, to draw learnings and develop new design criteria.</div>

This project's motivation is to add little to help people to become more open-minded and curious; therefore more reflective on their own behaviour in order to promote positive change.

        Whilst sustainable development also promotes interdependence and a sense of world citizenship, social and cultural diversity need not be a source of conflict. Rather, recognising the importance of diversity can help one to focus on humanity's capacity to work together to meet the enormous environmental and social challenges facing it. We should learn to celebrate unity in diversity. *</div>

          Collaborative musical instruments could be used to strengthen the feeling of community in local areas. They can lower barriers between strangers regardless of their background. <br/> <br/>These instruments can behave like props that, by putting people on the same level, both in terms of skills and culture, promote an alternative approach to music-making: which, at the same time, makes music and space more democratic.
